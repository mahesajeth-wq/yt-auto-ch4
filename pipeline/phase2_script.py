Use the following hook concept as your core theme: "{hook_formatted}" (short hook: "{topic.get('short_hook', '')}").

Narration Style Requirements:
1. Pacing & Punchiness: 5 to 15 words per segment's narration. CRITICAL: NEVER split a single sentence across multiple segments! Each segment MUST contain 1 or 2 complete, self-contained sentences. If you split a sentence, the voiceover will pause awkwardly mid-sentence.
2. Conversational & Extreme Simplicity: Use ONLY 5th-grade vocabulary. Extremely simple words, no complex grammar, no SAT words. Must be so simple a 10-year-old understands instantly.
3. Engaging Tone: The voiceover narration must be conversational, highly engaging, and relatable—like a friend telling an exciting story. Write the voiceover to be energetic, warm, and inviting.
2. Hook/Pattern Interrupt: Segment 1 must immediately shatter the viewer's attention. Start mid-consequence, not mid-setup. DO NOT use introductory filler like "Did you know..." or "Have you ever wondered...". Go straight to the verifiable outcome in under 8 words.
4. Emotional/Sensory Triggers: Use strong, dramatic verbs and adjectives (e.g., "shattered", "forged", "betrayed", "banned", "secret", "exposed", "deciphered").
5. No Fluff: Get straight to the documented historical facts. Every word must justify its existence.

For every `broll_query` field, write a SHORT, SPECIFIC, STOCK-FOOTAGE-FRIENDLY
search term of 3-6 words MAXIMUM. Write exactly what a human would type into
a stock video search bar (Pexels, Pixabay, etc). Use concrete nouns and visual
objects — NOT instructions or descriptions of what you want.

CORRECT examples: "bridge construction aerial", "steel beam welding closeup",
"concrete pouring foundation", "wind tunnel testing model", "dam spillway water flow",
"crane lifting steel girder", "earthquake damaged building", "engineering blueprint technical drawing"

WRONG examples: "visually jarring close-up of the topic", "macro b-roll of engineering
element", "closing beautiful shot returning to start", "diagram concept visualization",
"DNA double helix" (not relevant), "chemical" (not relevant)

IMPORTANT B-ROLL RULES:
- Stock video sites have excellent coverage of construction, architecture, infrastructure, and engineering processes.
- For specific structures, search by name: "Golden Gate Bridge", "Hoover Dam", "Burj Khalifa".
- For abstract engineering concepts, use: "structural stress test", "wind load simulation", "foundation construction site".
- ALWAYS include concrete visual anchors to give the video an authentic engineering documentary feel.

For each segment, also provide a `broll_queries` array with 3-5 ALTERNATIVE search terms for the same visual concept. These should be synonyms, related concepts, or different angles on the same subject. The first entry should match `broll_query`.

For any named structure or engineer: ALWAYS include their name in the query.

You MUST return your response ONLY as a raw JSON object with no markdown syntax. The JSON structure MUST be exactly like this:

For Segment 1 specifically:
- `broll_query` MUST describe a high-motion, high-contrast, visually arresting shot (fast motion, dramatic close-up, panning shot) — this is the opening pattern-interrupt.

For the final segment (Segment {segment_count}) specifically:
- MUST be a 1-sentence Call-to-Action that matches the video's emotional tone and drives viewers to check the link in description/bio.
- MUST literally include the exact phrase "link in bio" or "link in the description".
- Good examples: "For more mind-blowing details, check the link in bio.", "The full breakdown is waiting at the link in bio.", "Ready for the deep dive? Check the link in description."
- NEVER write a generic CTA like "Dive deeper!" or "Want to learn more?" without explicitly mentioning the link.
- Relaxed word limit: Up to 15 words to allow natural integration of the link phrase.
- MUST resolve all loops and end on a transition that flows seamlessly back into Segment 1's hook narration.
- The final sentence should THEMATICALLY echo or re-contextualize the IDEA from Segment 1's hook.

The script must have 15 to 18 segments, each targeting 25-35 seconds of narration.

Narration Style Requirements:
1. Conversational & Simple Language: Use very simple, easy-to-understand, and highly relatable words that anyone can easily follow. Avoid obscure, complex, or overly difficult English vocabulary. Keep the narration friendly, extremely engaging, and relatable—like a friend explaining an amazing topic.
2. Engaging Tone: The voiceover narration must be conversational, highly engaging, and relatable—like a friend telling an exciting story. Write the voiceover to be energetic, warm, and inviting.
Structure the narrative into:
- Intro hook: start mid-consequence and create an information gap (segments 1-2)
- Act 1: The structure, machine, or mechanism being examined (segments 3-7)
- Act 2: The failure, near-miss, or surprising design decision (segments 8-12)
- Act 3: The fix, the safety standard that followed, or the engineering legacy (segments 13-16)
